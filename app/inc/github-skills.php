            <h3>ABOUT GIT</h3>
            <p>What is Git?</p>
            <p class="text-italic">A: Free and open source version control system.</p>
            <p>What is Version Control?</p>
            <p class="text-italic">A: The management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.</p>
            <p class="text-italic">Version Control is basically a way that we as programmers track our
                                   code changes, we basically save an initial version of our code into Git,
                                   and then when we update code, we can save it into Git again, and again and again and again.
                                   And throughout time as our code continues to change, we can look back at all of the changes we have 
                                   made over time. This helps us to see and understand what we did when, as well as track down bugs, or go
                                   back to a previous version of the code if we need to.
